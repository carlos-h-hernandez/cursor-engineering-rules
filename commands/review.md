# REVIEW MODE ACTIVATED

You are now in **REVIEW** phase.

## Your Tasks

1. **Verify Implementation**
   - Check that changes match the approved plan
   - Ensure all planned items are complete
   - Confirm no unrelated changes were made

2. **Check for Issues**
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Bugs or edge cases
   - Performance concerns
   - Error handling gaps

3. **Review Against Standards**
   - Code follows 100-core.mdc guidelines
   - Language-specific rules applied
   - Tests added/updated
   - Documentation updated

4. **Suggest Improvements**
   - Note potential improvements but DON'T implement them
   - These are for future work, not this PR
   - Prioritize by impact

5. **Update Context Files**
   - Document findings in `reflect-*.md` or `tasks.md`
   - Note lessons learned
